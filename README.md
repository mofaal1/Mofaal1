## Projects


### Intrusion Detection with Snort
- **Description:** Implemented and explored Snort, an open-source network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS), to enhance understanding of defensive measures against network-based attacks.

### Metasploit Attack and Exploitation
- **Description:** Deployed and configured virtual machines within a lab environment to simulate real-world cybersecurity scenarios. Conducted Metasploit attack "Eternal Blue" to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access.

### Network Security Lab - Penetration Testing and Analysis
- **Description:** Configured and initiated virtual machines to replicate network security scenarios. Employed tools like Wireshark and Nmap for real-time monitoring, analysis, and vulnerability assessment.

### Trojan Deployment and Rootkit Implementation
- **Description:** Implemented Beast Trojan on a Windows 7 virtual machine and conducted penetration testing on a Windows Server 2003 VM. Utilized Hacker Defender rootkit to conceal the presence of the Beast Trojan.


### JavaFX MySQL Application Development
- **Description:** Implemented a three-tier architecture application utilizing JavaFX for the user interface tier and JDBC for database connectivity.


### Active Directory Implementation and Security Project
- **Description:** Designed and implemented Active Directory OU structure for the Student Union department, demonstrating share and file-system security.
